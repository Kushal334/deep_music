# Folder organization

## Folder generated_midis:

Contains sample sequences generated by the different model architectures.
The following architectures were tested with a single note (0 or 14) as a primer:

**Jazz dataset:**
- j1: state refeed, dropout, no attention
- j2: state refeed, no dropout, no attention

- j3: no state refeed, no dropout, no attention
- j4: no state refeed, dropout, no attention
- j5: no state refeed, dropout, attention

**Lakh dataset:**
- l1: no state refeed, dropout, no attention
- l2: no state refeed, dropout, attention


## Folder input_midis:

Contains sample melodies that were used to train the different model architectures.
Three sample melodies are given for each dataset (lakh dataset/clean midi and jazz dataset)
